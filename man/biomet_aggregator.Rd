\usage{
biomet_aggregator(
  aggr_var = c("hour", "day", "week", "month", "year", "growing_season"),
  df = gapfilling_list_hals$site_df,
  datetime = "datetime",
  aggr_fun = c("mean", "mean", "mean", "sum", "mean"),

}
\arguments{
\item{aggr_var}{Type of aggregation, either of "hour","day","week","month","year","growing_season"}

\item{df}{dataframe containing the variables to aggregate and the timestamp column}

\item{datetime}{timestamp column name already in a POSIXct format and UTC timezone to avoid summertime problems}

\item{aggr_fun}{Vector of aggregation functions to apply to each biomet variable. This should be the same lendth and same order as biomet_vars}

\item{biomet_vars}{Vector of Biomet variables to aggregate}

\item{month_start_growing_season}{When aggr_var is "growing_seaon", this is the month considered as the start of the growing season}

\item{month_end_growing_season}{When aggr_var is "growing_seaon", this is the month considered as the end of the growing season}

\item{na.rm_val}{logical, TRUE if you want NAs to be ignored. Note that this means that sums may be calculated even when there are missing values, which is misleading.}
}
\value{
a summarized dataframe, containing the aggregation timescale variables and the aggregated values
